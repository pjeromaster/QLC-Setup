# MUI Dark Theme for QLC+

Thank you for purchasing this premium theme for QLC+. With additional support from people like you, we can take QLC+ to the next level.

## Installation

You'll find installation instructions within each of the folders `/Linux`,`/MacOS` and `/Windows`. There is both an easy automatic script and a more manual approach if you don't have permissions to run scripts on your machine.

## Troubleshooting
### I can't see the dropdown arrows/checkboxes/scrollbars?!
Make sure you've created the QT-Compatible path correctly. There should be no forwardslash at the end of the path.

The StyleSheet needs to have appropriate paths to the images. Open the StyleSheet and make sure that every line that looks like this: `image: url("{{resources_path}}/radio_unchecked.png");` has been correctly replaced with your QT-Compatible full path.

Also, make sure you've copied the `ui-MUI-Dark-Mode` folder to the QLC+ user directory correctly. 

## Uninstalling
Simply delete the `ui-MUI-Dark-Mode` folder and `qlcplusStyle.qss` stylesheet from your QLC+ user folder. Alternitavely, you can also run the install script again and follow the prompts to uninstall the theme.


## Thank You!
